# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves redesigning the existing technology marquee section to implement a modern diagonal split layout. The new design will feature a diagonal divider separating descriptive text on the left from animated technology icons on the right, while maintaining the dual-direction marquee functionality that showcases various technologies and tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to see a visually striking diagonal split marquee section, so that I can immediately understand the technologies section while being engaged by modern design aesthetics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the marquee section loads THEN the system SHALL display a diagonal divider that splits the section into left and right areas
2. WHEN viewing the left side THEN the system SHALL show "Technologies & Tools" as the main heading
3. WHEN viewing the left side THEN the system SHALL display "Crafting modern experiences with cutting-edge technologies" as the subtitle
4. WHEN viewing the diagonal divider THEN the system SHALL render it as a clean, bold line that creates visual separation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to see technology icons moving in opposite directions on dual marquee rows, so that I can view all technologies in an engaging animated format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the marquee section loads THEN the system SHALL display two horizontal rows of technology icons on the right side of the diagonal
2. WHEN the top marquee row animates THEN the system SHALL move icons from left to right continuously
3. WHEN the bottom marquee row animates THEN the system SHALL move icons from right to left continuously
4. WHEN both marquee rows are active THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth, synchronized opposite-direction animations
5. WHEN technology icons are displayed THEN the system SHALL use existing images from the public directory

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want the redesigned marquee to be responsive and accessible, so that I can view it properly on any device and with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the diagonal layout to remain visually appealing and functional
2. WHEN viewing on tablet devices THEN the system SHALL maintain the diagonal split while adjusting proportions appropriately
3. WHEN viewing on desktop devices THEN the system SHALL display the full diagonal split design as intended
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels for the marquee content
5. WHEN users prefer reduced motion THEN the system SHALL respect the prefers-reduced-motion setting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want the new marquee design to maintain high performance, so that the page loads quickly and animations run smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the marquee section loads THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps animation performance
2. WHEN technology icons are rendered THEN the system SHALL use optimized image loading techniques
3. WHEN animations are running THEN the system SHALL use CSS transforms for hardware acceleration
4. WHEN the section is not in view THEN the system SHALL pause animations to conserve resources
5. WHEN the section comes into view THEN the system SHALL resume animations smoothly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the portfolio, I want the new marquee component to integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase, so that it follows established patterns and doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new design THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing TechMarquee component structure
2. WHEN the component renders THEN the system SHALL use the existing technology data from portfolio-data.ts
3. WHEN styling the component THEN the system SHALL follow the established CSS module and Tailwind patterns
4. WHEN the component is integrated THEN the system SHALL maintain existing lazy loading and intersection observer functionality
5. WHEN the component is complete THEN the system SHALL pass all existing performance and accessibility tests
